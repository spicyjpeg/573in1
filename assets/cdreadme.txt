[ Usage ]

Burn the provided disc image and use it by simply swapping out your System 573's
current game disc for the burned one. Ensure DIP switch 4 (the rightmost one) is
off in order to force the 573 to boot from the CD-ROM drive rather than from the
internal flash memory. Remember to insert any security cartridges, PCMCIA cards
and/or connect a hard drive, CF card or other storage device as a secondary
drive on the same IDE bus as the CD-ROM drive, prior to turning on the system.

WARNING: 573in1 is an experimental tool provided with no warranty whatsoever. It
is not guaranteed to work and improper usage can PERMANENTLY BRICK your System
573 security cartridges. Use this tool at your own risk.
