                                 Version {PROJECT_VERSION}

[ Usage ]

Burn the provided disc image and use it by simply swapping out your System 573's
current game disc for the burned one. Ensure DIP switch 4 (the rightmost one) is
off in order to force the 573 to boot from the CD-ROM drive rather than from the
internal flash memory. Remember to insert any security cartridges, PCMCIA cards
and/or connect a hard drive, CF card or other storage device as a secondary
drive on the same IDE bus as the CD-ROM drive, prior to turning on the system.
