# Usage

Use this disc by simply inserting it into your System 573 and rebooting. Ensure
DIP switch 4 (the rightmost one) is off in order to force the 573 to boot from
the CD-ROM drive rather than the internal flash memory. Remember to insert the
cartridge you want to reset, reflash or dump prior to turning on the system.
